    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 19, 2026</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Resurface mobile application ("App") operated by Resurface ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years of age to use the App. If you are under 18, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you meet these eligibility requirements.</p>

    <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To access certain features, you must create an account using email/password, Apple Sign-In, or Google Sign-In. You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration</li>
        <li>Maintain and promptly update your account information</li>
        <li>Keep your login credentials secure and confidential</li>
        <li>Accept responsibility for all activity that occurs under your account</li>
        <li>Notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access to your account</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or that we reasonably believe have been compromised.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions & Payments</h2>
    <p>Resurface offers a free tier with limited features and a paid Pro subscription that unlocks additional capabilities. All subscriptions are processed through Apple's In-App Purchase system and are subject to Apple's applicable terms and policies.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at the time of purchase confirmation.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period. Renewal is charged at the same rate unless we notify you of a price change in advance.</li>
        <li><strong>Free Trials:</strong> If offered, free trials automatically convert to a paid subscription at the end of the trial period unless cancelled beforehand. Any unused portion of a free trial is forfeited upon purchasing a subscription.</li>
        <li><strong>Managing Subscriptions:</strong> You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time via iPhone Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions → Resurface.</li>
        <li><strong>Refunds:</strong> All refund requests must be directed to Apple in accordance with their refund policy. We do not process refunds directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We may change subscription prices from time to time. Any price changes will take effect at the start of the next billing cycle following notice to you.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Free Tier Limitations</h2>

        <li>Email forwarding is not available</li>
